# Ellipsometry

Optimization of Ellipsometric measurements with Gaussian noise

**Optimization Algorithm**: 

Applying SCE UA (Shuffled complex evolution optimization algorithm) by [Duan et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169494900574) with the modification of python implementation of 
[Stijn Van Hoey ](https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/Optimization_SCE)

The optimization can be run by *ellipsometry.py* or *ellipsometry.ipynb*
